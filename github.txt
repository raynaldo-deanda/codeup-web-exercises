Steps to pushing

1. git status(not needed but I can check what isn't add and commited)
2. git add .(add files to staging/history)(alternative git add <filename>)
3. git commit -m "your label for this commit"
4. git push origin <branchname> (to find what branch you are on, do 'git branch')(will push local commits to github)
5. git status(should say "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/branchname'"git remi)
