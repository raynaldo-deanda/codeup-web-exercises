        Everglades National Park

        <li>Thirty-nine native Florida species that may occur in Everglades National Park are federally listed as threatened or endangered, or are candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973</li>

        <li>Everglades National Park protects a portion of the Greater Everglades, the largest freshwater marsh in the United States.</li>

        <li>Primarily consisting of limestone, the bedrock geology of Everglades National Park has responded over time to the ongoing processes of weathering, erosion, compaction of organic sediments, unique hydrologic conditions, and episodes of sea-level rise and fall to produce the landscapes we see today.</li>

        <li>In the early 20th century, African Americans began to live and work in the Flamingo and Cape Sable areas of what would later become Everglades National Park.</li>

        Big Bend National Park
      </h3>

      <ul class="card-text bg-change text-light">
        <li>From 500 million years ago (mya) through approximately 300 million years ago the Big Bend area was near the western portion of a deep-ocean trough that extended from present-day Arkansas and Oklahoma to West Texas. </li>

        <li>Abundant fossils in Big Bend, including some found nowhere else in the world, record the existence and demise of dinosaurs and the flourishing of mammals, enabling us to ponder evolution and our impermanence in the world.</li>

        <li>Thirty-one species of snakes, including four species of rattlesnakes, inhabit Big Bend. Snakes may be more active after summer rains.</li>

        <li>In the 1880s, ranchers migrated into Big Bend to raise livestock in such numbers that the land was soon overgrazed. By the late 1890’s with the discovery of mercury (also known as quicksilver), mining operations replaced ranching as the main economic force of the region.</li>

        Death Valley National Park
      </h3>

      <ul class="card-text bg-change text-light">
        <li>The salt flats in Badwater Basin cover nearly 200 square miles, among the largest protected salt flats in the world.
        </li>

        <li>Death Valley is famous as the hottest place on earth and driest place in North America. The world record highest air temperature of 134°F (57°C) was recorded at Furnace Creek on July 10, 1913.</li>

        <li>The Mojave Desert is rich with cacti and succulent species, yet in Death Valley National Park they are scarce due to the extremes of heat, dryness, and soil salinity. Even so, cactus grow from an elevation of 400 feet above sea level to the summits of the surrounding mountains.</li>

        <li>The Park encompasses over three million acres and ranges in elevation from 282 feet below sea level to 11,049 feet above sea level. This provides a variety of habitats in which plants and animals have become established. </li>
